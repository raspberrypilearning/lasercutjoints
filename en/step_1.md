## Introduction

Makers and hackers love to build a wide variety of projects. These creations may range from the fun, interesting, and weird to the serious, practical, and useful. They may be intended for music creation, gaming, education, assistive technology, communications, holiday decoration, media streaming, puzzles, theatre props, and — well, the sky’s the limit! These wonderful projects are often made of electronic components, mechanical parts, motors, microcontrollers, buttons, switches, dials, speakers, LEDs, keypads, batteries, displays, and even small embedded computers. Despite this infinite, delightful variety, nearly all projects have one thing in common: once the prototyping is done, and the project is ready to be deployed and used, it needs a case or enclosure to bring all of the elements together, to provide some protection, and even to give form and layout to their inputs and outputs. 

Given the variety and creativity of your projects, why settle for an off-the-shelf, generic project box with holes drilled and cut into it, when you can build your own case that’s customised for your exact needs? With access to a laser cutter at your local hackerspace, or by using an online vendor such as [ponoko.com](https://www.ponoko.com/){:target="_blank"} (which has local hubs in a number of regions), you can build exactly what you need to suit your project enclosure needs.
